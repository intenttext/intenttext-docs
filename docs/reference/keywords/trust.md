# Trust Keywords

Keywords for document integrity — approvals, signatures, sealing, history, policy enforcement, and formal amendments.

## `approve:`

**Category:** Trust
**Since:** v2.8

Named approval stamp. Records who approved the document, their role, and when.

### Syntax

```
approve: description | by: name | role: title | at: timestamp | ref: reference
```

### Properties

| Property | Type   | Required | Description                                 |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `by`     | string | yes      | Approver name                               |
| `role`   | string | no       | Approver's role or title                    |
| `at`     | string | no       | Approval timestamp (ISO 8601)               |
| `ref`    | string | no       | Reference to approval authority or document |

### Examples

```intenttext
approve: Legal review complete | by: Sarah Chen | role: General Counsel | at: 2026-03-05
approve: Finance approved | by: James Miller | role: CFO | at: 2026-03-06
approve: Compliance review | by: Maria Santos | role: Compliance Officer | ref: Policy CMP-2026-01
```

### Notes

- Multiple `approve:` blocks are common — legal, finance, compliance, management
- Requires `track:` to be set first
- Queryable: `intenttext query . --type approve --by "Sarah Chen"`

---

## `sign:`

**Category:** Trust
**Since:** v2.8

Cryptographic digital signature. The signer's identity and a content hash are recorded in the document.

### Syntax

```
sign: signer name | role: title | at: timestamp | hash: algorithm:value
```

### Properties

| Property | Type   | Required | Description                     |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `role`   | string | no       | Signer's role                   |
| `at`     | string | no       | Signing timestamp (ISO 8601)    |
| `hash`   | string | no       | Content hash at time of signing |

### Examples

```intenttext
sign: Ahmed Al-Rashid | role: CEO | at: 2026-03-06T14:32:00Z | hash: sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6
sign: James Miller | role: CFO | at: 2026-03-06T15:00:00Z
```

### `sign:` vs `signline:`

|                  | `sign:`                                 | `signline:`                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Type**         | Digital                                 | Physical                                |
| **Verification** | Cryptographic hash — machine-verifiable | Visual line on paper — human-verifiable |
| **Lives in**     | The `.it` file permanently              | The printed/PDF output                  |
| **Queryable**    | Yes                                     | Yes                                     |
| **Use case**     | File integrity verification             | Paper contract signatures               |

Use both when a contract needs digital verification _and_ paper signatures.

---

## `freeze:`

**Category:** Trust
**Since:** v2.8
**Aliases:** `lock:`

Seal the document. After `freeze:`, any edit to the content above invalidates the hash.

### Syntax

```
freeze: | status: locked | at: timestamp | hash: algorithm:value
```

### Properties

| Property | Type   | Description                         |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `status` | string | `locked`                            |
| `at`     | string | Sealing timestamp (ISO 8601)        |
| `hash`   | string | Content hash of the frozen document |

### Examples

```intenttext
freeze: | status: locked | at: 2026-03-06T14:33:00Z | hash: sha256:e5f6a7b8
```

### Notes

- `freeze:` content is typically empty — data is in properties
- After freezing, the only permitted additions are `amendment:` blocks
- Use `intenttext seal` to compute the hash and add `sign:` + `freeze:` automatically
- Use `intenttext verify` to check the hash against current content

---

## `revision:`

**Category:** Trust
**Since:** v2.8

Auto-generated change record. Appears below the `history:` boundary. Managed by the CLI — you don't write these manually.

### Syntax

```
revision: | version: value | at: timestamp | by: author | change: description | id: block_id | block: type | section: name | was: old_value | now: new_value
```

### Properties

| Property  | Type   | Description                       |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `version` | string | Version identifier                |
| `at`      | string | When the change was made          |
| `by`      | string | Who made the change               |
| `change`  | string | Description of what changed       |
| `id`      | string | Block identifier                  |
| `block`   | string | Block type that changed           |
| `section` | string | Section where the change occurred |
| `was`     | string | Previous value                    |
| `now`     | string | New value                         |

### Examples

```intenttext
history:
revision: | version: 1.0 | at: 2026-03-01 | by: Ahmed | change: Initial draft
revision: | version: 1.1 | at: 2026-03-03 | by: Sarah | change: Legal review — clause 4.2 updated | section: Payment | was: Net 30 | now: Net 15
revision: | version: 1.2 | at: 2026-03-05 | by: Ahmed | change: Final edits
```

### Notes

- Always below the `history:` boundary
- Generated by the CLI, not written by hand
- Queryable with `intenttext history`

---

## `history:`

**Category:** Trust
**Since:** v2.12

History boundary marker. Separates the live document from its machine-managed history section. Produces no rendered output — it is a structural marker only.

### Syntax

```
history:
```

### Examples

```intenttext
title: Service Agreement
note: Terms and conditions...

approve: Legal review | by: Sarah Chen | role: General Counsel
sign: Ahmed Al-Rashid | role: CEO | hash: sha256:a1b2c3d4
freeze: | status: locked | hash: sha256:e5f6a7b8

history:
revision: | version: 1.0 | at: 2026-03-01 | by: Ahmed | change: Initial draft
revision: | version: 1.1 | at: 2026-03-03 | by: Sarah | change: Legal review
```

### Notes

- Written automatically by `intenttext seal` and `intenttext amend` — never by the user
- Everything above `history:` is the document. Everything below is machine-managed history
- Renderers ignore the history section — it is not visible in HTML or print output
- `intenttext history <file>` reads the content after this marker
- If `history:` is present but no `freeze:` block exists, the parser emits a `HISTORY_WITHOUT_FREEZE` warning
- Replaces the old `---` + `// history` pattern from v2.11 and earlier

### Backward compatibility

The old two-line pattern (`---` followed by `// history`) is still recognized by the parser but emits a `LEGACY_HISTORY_BOUNDARY` diagnostic warning. New documents always use `history:`.

## `policy:`

**Category:** Trust
**Since:** v2.7
**Aliases:** `rule:`, `constraint:`, `guard:`, `requirement:`

Enforceable constraint or rule. Declares policies that agents and workflows must follow.

### Syntax

```
policy: description | scope: area | enforce: level
```

### Properties

| Property  | Type   | Description                                           |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope`   | string | What the policy applies to                            |
| `enforce` | string | `strict` (must follow) or `advisory` (recommendation) |

### Examples

```intenttext
policy: No production changes during business hours | scope: production | enforce: strict
policy: All contracts require legal review | scope: contracts | enforce: strict
policy: Prefer email over phone for initial contact | scope: communications | enforce: advisory
```

---

## `amendment:`

**Category:** Trust
**Since:** v2.11
**Aliases:** `amend:`, `change:`

Formal change to a frozen document. Preserves the original seal while recording what was changed, where, who authorized it, and when.

### Syntax

```
amendment: description | section: target | was: previous | now: current | ref: identifier | by: author | at: timestamp | approved-by: approver | hash: value
```

### Properties

| Property      | Type   | Required | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `section`     | string | yes      | Which section was amended      |
| `was`         | string | no       | The previous value or text     |
| `now`         | string | yes      | The new value or text          |
| `ref`         | string | no       | Amendment reference identifier |
| `by`          | string | no       | Who authored the amendment     |
| `at`          | string | no       | Amendment timestamp            |
| `approved-by` | string | no       | Who approved the amendment     |
| `hash`        | string | no       | Hash of the amendment block    |

### Examples

```intenttext
amendment: Payment terms updated | section: Payment | was: Net 30 | now: Net 15 | ref: Amendment #1 | by: Ahmed Al-Rashid | approved-by: Sarah Chen
amendment: Scope extended | section: Scope | now: Includes Phase 2 deliverables | ref: Amendment #2 | by: Ahmed Al-Rashid | at: 2026-04-01
amendment: Contact updated | section: Parties | was: j.miller@old.co | now: j.miller@globaltech.co | ref: Amendment #3
```

### The amendment model

Without `amendment:`, changing a frozen document means:

1. Breaking the seal (invalidating `freeze:` and `sign:`)
2. Making edits
3. Re-approving
4. Re-signing
5. Re-freezing

All original signatures are voided. The audit trail has a gap.

With `amendment:`:

- The original seal is **preserved**
- The amendment is **additive** — it records the change alongside the sealed content
- Each amendment can have its own approval chain (`approved-by:`)
- `intenttext verify` reports both the original seal status and all amendments

### CLI

```bash
intenttext amend contract.it \
  --section "Payment" \
  --was "Net 30" \
  --now "Net 15" \
  --ref "Amendment #1" \
  --by "Ahmed Al-Rashid"
```

### Notes

- Validation error `AMENDMENT_WITHOUT_FREEZE` if the document has no `freeze:` block
- Amendments appear after `freeze:` but before the `history:` boundary
- Each amendment is independently queryable
- This is the page every lawyer will read: amendments preserve the evidentiary chain
