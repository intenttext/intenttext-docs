## Step by step

1. **Identity** — `title:` and `summary:` identify the invoice. `meta:` with `track: true` enables the trust chain.
2. **Layout** — `page:`, `font:`, `header:`, `footer:` control PDF rendering.
3. **Contacts** — `contact:` blocks for both parties. These are queryable across all your invoices.
4. **Table** — Standard table for line items. For templates, use `each: items` to make this dynamic.
5. **Metrics** — `metric:` blocks for subtotal, tax, total. Queryable and renderable with emphasis.
6. **Deadline** — `deadline:` for payment due date. Color-coded by proximity in rendered output.
7. **Track** — `track:` enables the revision history.

## Query it

```bash
# Find all pending invoices
intenttext query ./invoices --type deadline --status pending --format table

# Find invoices for a specific client
intenttext query ./invoices --type contact --content "GlobalTech" --format json

# Total revenue across all invoices
intenttext query ./invoices --type metric --content "Total Due" --format csv
```

## Render to PDF

```bash
intenttext invoice.it --print --theme corporate
intenttext invoice.it --pdf --theme corporate
```

## Template version

Convert this to a reusable template. See [Building Templates](../templates/building-templates).

## Next steps

- [Dynamic Tables](../templates/dynamic-tables) — make line items dynamic with `each:`
- [Sealing Contracts](../trust/sealing-contracts) — add integrity verification
- [Deadline Tracking](../organizations/deadline-tracking) — track payment deadlines across invoices
