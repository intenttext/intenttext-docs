# Trust & Signing

How to approve, sign, seal, verify, and amend `.it` documents.

## The trust lifecycle

```
draft → tracked → approved → signed → frozen → amended (optional)
```

Each step is a keyword. Each keyword is a line in the document. No external system required.

## Step 1: Track changes

```intenttext
track: | version: 1.0 | by: Ahmed Al-Rashid
```

This activates history. From this point, the CLI can record revisions below the `---` history boundary.

## Step 2: Approve

Named approvals with role and timestamp:

```intenttext
approve: Legal review complete | by: Sarah Chen | role: General Counsel | at: 2026-03-05
approve: Finance approved | by: James Miller | role: CFO | at: 2026-03-06
```

Multiple approvals are common — legal, finance, management, compliance.

## Step 3: Sign

Cryptographic digital signature:

```intenttext
sign: Ahmed Al-Rashid | role: CEO | at: 2026-03-06T14:32:00Z | hash: sha256:a1b2c3d4...
```

`sign:` is digital — it lives in the file and is verifiable by code.

## Step 4: Freeze

Seal the document:

```intenttext
freeze: | status: locked | at: 2026-03-06T14:33:00Z | hash: sha256:e5f6a7b8...
```

After `freeze:`, the document is immutable. Any edit changes the content, which invalidates the hash.

## Seal with the CLI

One command does approve + sign + freeze:

```bash
intenttext seal contract.it --signer "Ahmed Al-Rashid" --role "CEO"
```

This:

1. Computes the content hash
2. Adds a `sign:` block
3. Adds a `freeze:` block with the hash
4. Writes the sealed file

## Verify anytime

```bash
intenttext verify contract.it
```

```
✓ Document integrity verified
  Signer: Ahmed Al-Rashid (CEO)
  Sealed: 2026-03-06T14:33:00Z
  Hash: sha256:a1b2c3...
  Amendments: 0
  Status: INTACT — no modifications detected
```

If someone edits the file:

```
✗ Document integrity FAILED
  Expected hash: sha256:a1b2c3...
  Actual hash:   sha256:x9y8z7...
  Status: TAMPERED — content has been modified since sealing
```

## Step 5: Amend (when needed)

A frozen contract needs to change. You have two options:

**Without `amendment:` (the old way):**

1. Break the seal
2. Edit the document
3. Re-approve
4. Re-sign
5. Re-freeze

All original signatures are voided. The audit trail has a gap.

**With `amendment:` (the IntentText way):**

```intenttext
amendment: Payment terms updated | section: Payment | was: Net 30 | now: Net 15 | ref: Amendment #1 | by: Ahmed Al-Rashid | approved-by: Sarah Chen
```

The original seal is preserved. The amendment is additive — it records what changed, where, and who authorized it.

## Amend with the CLI

```bash
intenttext amend contract.it \
  --section "Payment" \
  --was "Net 30" \
  --now "Net 15" \
  --ref "Amendment #1" \
  --by "Ahmed Al-Rashid"
```

## Verify after amendment

```bash
intenttext verify contract.it
```

```
✓ Document integrity verified
  Signer: Ahmed Al-Rashid (CEO)
  Sealed: 2026-03-06T14:33:00Z
  Hash: sha256:a1b2c3...
  Amendments: 1
    #1: Payment terms updated (2026-03-15) by Ahmed Al-Rashid
  Status: INTACT — original seal preserved, 1 amendment applied
```

## View history

```bash
intenttext history contract.it
```

```
v1.0  2026-03-01  Ahmed Al-Rashid   Initial draft
v1.1  2026-03-03  Sarah Chen         Legal review — clause 4.2 updated
v1.2  2026-03-05  Ahmed Al-Rashid   Final edits
      2026-03-06  Ahmed Al-Rashid   SEALED
      2026-03-15  Ahmed Al-Rashid   Amendment #1: Payment terms
```

Filter by author or section:

```bash
intenttext history contract.it --by "Sarah Chen"
intenttext history contract.it --section "Payment"
intenttext history contract.it --json
```

## The history boundary

The `---` divider separates the document from machine-managed history:

```intenttext
title: Consulting Agreement
note: Terms and conditions...
freeze: | status: locked

---
// history
revision: | version: 1.0 | at: 2026-03-01 | by: Ahmed | change: Initial draft
revision: | version: 1.1 | at: 2026-03-03 | by: Sarah | change: Legal review
```

History is below the line. You read it, but the CLI manages it.

## Physical signatures for print

`sign:` is digital — cryptographic, in-file, verifiable.
`signline:` is physical — a printed signature line for paper:

```intenttext
signline: Ahmed Al-Rashid | role: CEO | org: Acme Corp | date-line: Date | width: 60%
signline: James Miller | role: CFO | org: GlobalTech Inc. | date-line: Date | width: 60%
```

Use both in contracts that need digital verification _and_ paper signatures:

```intenttext
sign: Ahmed Al-Rashid | role: CEO | at: 2026-03-06T14:32:00Z
signline: Ahmed Al-Rashid | role: CEO | org: Acme Corp | date-line: Date
```

|                  | `sign:`            | `signline:`        |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Type**         | Digital            | Physical           |
| **Verification** | Cryptographic hash | Visual on paper    |
| **Lives in**     | The `.it` file     | The printed output |
| **Queryable**    | Yes                | Yes                |
